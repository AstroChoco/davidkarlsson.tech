I have 8 years of experience with the documentation industry.
In this time, I have had the opportunity of working with every aspect
of documentation development, including:

- Graphics design
- Technical illustration
- Technical writing
- Conversion and migration
- Information architecture

## Background

I started my career in visual communication, creating technical 2D vector
and 3D graphics. Soon after I also got into writing. That was also when I
was first introduced to structured writing in XML.

With time, I grew more and more interested in tools and frameworks.
I began working with conversion and data migration projects.
Those typically involved moving unstructured or semi-structured content
into a topic-based information architecture and a CCMS.

For years have evangelized DITA, and content strategy projects became my
primary occupation.

I am self-taught in every discipline except illustration/graphics design.

## Present

Nowadays, I have largely moved away from XML-based tooling, in favor of
[docs as code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/). As I spent
more time I spent in software projects, it became obvious to me that the traditional
tools stack didn't quite satisfy the needs of agile software development.
Technical writers need a way to keep up with the pace of developers.
I believe that docs as code is the way to do that.

As a side-effect of deep-diving into git workflows and static site generators,
I've gotten heavily invested in web development. And I love it! That's also
the main reason behind creating this website.

## About this site

The code for this site is all available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dvdksn/davidkarlsson.tech)!

I created this website from scratch, using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

For the hosting and build workflow, I use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
