By profession, I'm a technical writer: I make documentation.

Unprofessionally, I'm a father.
I'm also enthusiastic about Formula 1 and catch and release fishing.

## My background

I have a background doing:

- Graphics design
- Technical illustration
- Technical writing
- Conversion and migration
- Information architecture

I started my career in visual communication, creating technical vector graphics
and 3D animations. Soon I also started to work with text, as a technical writer.
I think being able to work multiple mediums is a great strength.
Sometimes, combining them helps to convey a message more clearly.

I am also violently interested in tools and frameworks surrounding documentation.
This fascination began when I was first introduced to structured writing with XML.
For years, I championed DITA as the one, true documentation framework.

Recently, I have gravitated away from XML-based tools, towards **docs as code**.
DevOps culture and CI/CD are both central concepts in modern software development.
There is no doubt that docs need to keep up with the blazing pace of engineers.
I believe that doing docs as code is the way to do that.
